| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                     I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 15  |   12-1pm    |                                                                                                                             I experimented and thought about different approaches, including a recursive method before I shied away from that. |
| Jan 17  |   11-12pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                         Dynamic Programming introduced; pivot to focus on that |
| Jan 21  |  10pm-11pm  |                                                                                                                                            Spent some time thinking about the problem and trying to improve code, still passing one test case. |
| Jan 22  |   9-10am    |                                                                                                                    began working on LongestPathTo and using that replace parts of the main program. Also created ArrayList for Adjacency List. |
| Jan 22  |   10:30-1   | Abandoned the Adjacency List stuff because I was having a hard time making sense of it in my head and better understood using an int array, but I'm not sure if it'll be as efficient or if it'll save space? Still not passing all cases yet. |
| Jan 23  | 10:50-12:15 |                              Continued expanding on the code without having expanded on LongestPathTo yet, I wanted to wait until the work inside the for-loop was semifinalized so I can cleanly replace it. Currently passes 4/5 test cases. |

| April 5 |  9-10pm   |                                                                                  I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 15  |  12-1pm   |          I experimented and thought about different approaches, including a recursive method before I shied away from that. |
| Jan 17  |  11-12pm  |                                                                      Dynamic Programming introduced; pivot to focus on that |
| Jan 21  | 10pm-11pm |                         Spent some time thinking about the problem and trying to improve code, still passing one test case. |
| Jan 22  |  9-10am   | began working on LongestPathTo and using that replace parts of the main program. Also created ArrayList for Adjacency List. |
